# Computing infrastructure
The CYGNO exepriment develop a facility based on the [INFN cloud](https://www.cloud.infn.it/) to host:
- services for experiment monitoring, data analysis and simulation [status and access page](https://notebook.cygno.cloud.infn.it) 
- data experiment storage ([S3 based](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3)) - [status](https://t1metria.cr.cnaf.infn.it/d/000000123/bucket-s3-cygno?orgId=18)
- tape backup storage - [status](https://t1metria.cr.cnaf.infn.it/d/ZArHZvEMz/storage-usage-per-experiment?orgId=18&var-exp=cygn&var-vo=CYGNO&from=now-30d&to=now) 
- bach resources @ CNAF [status](https://t1metria.cr.cnaf.infn.it/d/QbafK_b7z/resource-usage-per-experiment?orgId=18&var-vo=CYGNO&var-exp=cygn&var-exp_cloud=CYGN)

CYGNO status of usage of [pledged resources](https://monitoring.cloud.infn.it:3000/d/u1sBcydVk/cygno-cloud-capacities?orgId=1)

Moreover, computing resources are available at LNF and LNGS (Cygno VM login and U-LITE nodes) and two [DAQ server](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kEzvfJK7WSXK2Y1vfEwRqcH9uSmoYsXl/view?usp=sharing) equipped with GPU

### DAQ and Middle Ware ###
* Data are collected by DAQ at LNF and LNGS [server configuration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kEzvfJK7WSXK2Y1vfEwRqcH9uSmoYsXl/view?usp=sharing) 
* Exeperiment data are monitored by the quasi-online recostracion by the [Middle Ware](https://github.com/CYGNUS-RD/middleware)

### CYGNO CLOUD Storage
Data collected by the experiment DAQ are automatically pushed on INFN [S3 cloud](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3) storage. The storage data and the experiment area for analysis and simulation can be acces and manage via: 

* Web Tool: https://s3webui.cygno.cloud.infn.it/
* Cloud CYGNO web interfaces tool: https://notebook01.cygno.cloud.infn.it/, https://notebook02.cygno.cloud.infn.it/
* CLI tool: https://github.com/CYGNUS-RD/cygno#cygno-cli-tool-cygno_repo
* 	Analysis: https://s3.cr.cnaf.infn.it:7480/cygno:cygno-analysis/tag/file-name
* 	Data: https://s3.cr.cnaf.infn.it:7480/cygno:cygno-data/tag/file-name
* 	Simulation: https://s3.cr.cnaf.infn.it:7480/cygno:cygno-sim/tag/file-name 

the cloud-storage/ contain tree backet:
* cloud-data: daq stored data, read only
* cloud-sim: simulation input and output data, read and write
* cloud-analysis: analysis input and output data, read and write

### Usage of the CYGNO notebook web interface and Cloud services
Two VM offer acces to cloud infrastrucure via web services based on jupyter notebook interface
* production: 
  - CYGNO [notebook 01](https://notebook01.cygno.cloud.infn.it/) (16 CPU/32 GB, [specification](https://novabench.com/parts/cpu/intel-core-broadwell-ibrs) )
  - CYGNO [notebook 02](https://notebook02.cygno.cloud.infn.it/) (16 CPU/32 GB);
* test environment [notebook 00](https://notebook00.cygno.cloud.infn.it/) (8 CPU/16 GB, [specification](https://www.intel.it/content/www/it/it/products/platforms/details/cascade-lake.html))
* the web inteface offer the possibility to run a specific software configuration. In general:
  * tag [dodas](https://github.com/DODAS-TS/dodas-docker-images) realises are the official one and approved by INFN
  * tag [gmazzitelli](https://github.com/gmazzitelli/dodas-docker-images) are realisesed fork of official project our project
### Tag 2.5 ###
Personal Bucket

To set it up:
Go to the storage web browser at: https://s3webui.cygno.cloud.infn.it/. Create a bucket named exactly as your USERNAME (all lowercase), which you can retrieve from a terminal in your notebook by typing: ```echo $USERNAME```

If needed, restart your notebook to enable the changes:
File → Hub Control Panel → Stop Server → Start Server

Optional: If you create a .bashrc file inside your personal bucket, it will be executed at startup, after the global login but before your local folder's .bashrc. This allows for custom startup configurations.

### Usage:
* to access the resource login with AAI credentials (see above to be athorized) 
<img src="https://github.com/CYGNUS-RD/cygno/blob/main/img/login.png" alt="login" style="width:400px;"/>
<img src="https://github.com/CYGNUS-RD/cygno/blob/main/img/aai.png" alt="login" style="width:400px;"/>

* start your notebook choosing version and RAM needed. That RAM is the maximum your interactive job can exploit. if there are concurred interactive job form other users draining the ram you can have your job killed. so don't ask the maximum of RAM if you don't relay need, and use condor queue instead of interactive jobs: https://github.com/CYGNUS-RD/mycondor#cygno-condor-queue 

<img src="https://github.com/CYGNUS-RD/cygno/blob/main/img/resorce.png" alt="login" style="width:400px;"/>

* run/edit your notebook Python/ROOT or script via the available buttons
<img src="https://github.com/CYGNUS-RD/cygno/blob/main/img/buttos.png" alt="login" style="width:400px;"/>

* the file system is availbale at the dafult path **/jupyter-workspace** that is divided in:
  * **/jupyter-workspace/cloud-storage/**: POSIX simulated access to S3 CYGNO storage system (experiment data, simulation and analysis repository, see also [CYGNO cloud storage](https://github.com/CYGNUS-RD/cygno/blob/main/infrastructure.md#cygno-cloud-storage)) 
  * under **/jupyter-workspace/cloud-storage/**: is also available a *USERNAME* directory (accessible only by user) and a *screach* area (accesible by anybody). Those directories are on S3 and permanent.
  * **/jupyter-workspace/private/**: working directory; this access to a local file system in case of cloud fault data can be lost (from v17 this foleder is atomaticaly backuped in **/jupyter-workspace/cloud-storage/USERNAME/private**, safe and always reachbele by [MINIO](https://minio.cloud.infn.it/))
  * **/jupyter-workspace/shared/**: shared working directory on lacal system

* it's strogly sujest to develop and run your code from **/jupyter-workspace/private** use private folder to develop and store your code NOT DATA or OUTPUTs 
* all paths to exploit installed softwares, and condor queues since realese v17, are configured by dafault. A personal setup can be configured editing the file **/jupyter-workspace/cloud-storage/USERNAME/.bashrc** (example git personal config)

# Tips and tricks
## ROOT setup to open ROOT files on cloud from remote
It is possible to remotely open files which are stored on the INFN s3 cloud storage without the need to download them.
For example, from the ROOT prompt line a file can be opened as: 
```
TFile *f= TFile::Open("https://s3.cloud.infn.it/v1/AUTH_2ebf769785574195bde2ff418deac08a/cygno-analysis/RECO/Winter22/reco_run04469_3D.root")
```
To be able to do so, ROOT needs to be configured to read Davix protocols at building time.
To build ROOT from source, follow [ROOT building from source](https://root.cern/install/build_from_source/).
To enable the Davix interface, during the cmake preparation of the build (at the moment 6/10/2023, it is point 3 of the guide just mentioned), add the the options ```-Dbuiltin_davix=ON -Ddavix=ON```.
The command to write from the <builddir> (notation identical to the one used in [ROOT building from source](https://root.cern/install/build_from_source/)) may look something like
```
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installdir> -Dbuiltin_davix=ON -Ddavix=ON <sourcedir> 
```
The -Ddavix=ON may not be necessary, but it was not tested without. Any other additional option your specific build may require must be added on the same line.
Continue the ROOT build as described on the provided link and ROOT files will be opened remotely.

If you already have a Davix package installed in your system, it should be enough to just add the ```-Ddavix=ON``` option. However, the printed result of the cmake command must be checked, since cmake looks for a Davix package, but if for any reason a package is not found, it does not raise an error. Thus, the build of ROOT will be successfull, but the user will not be able to open ROOT files from remote.
